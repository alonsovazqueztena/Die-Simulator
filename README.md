The die simulator is an application that actively simulates a six-sided die being rolled to then result in any random result from 1-6. 
This application utilizes one of the four key buttons as the input function (this will be to roll the die) and one of the 7-segment displays (the rightmost display) 
as the output function (this will be to display the result of the roll). This application is to be run for as long as the user desires to do as many die rolls as they 
want and to be terminated when another one of the key buttons is pressed by the user to exit.
